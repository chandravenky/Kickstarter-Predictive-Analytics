# Kickstarter-Predictive-Analytics

#Introduction (Section 1)
Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity and merchandising. Project creators choose a deadline and a minimum funding goal. If the goal is not met by the deadline, no funds are collected.
The goal of this project is to construct 2 supervised-learning models that predicts the pledged amount for a project and whether a project will be successful or not.
